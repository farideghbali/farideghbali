  I'm an experienced senior WordPress developer with a strong background in international projects. My expertise also

  practical, open-source projects that are designed to bring value to everyday users, providing developers and users
  alike with tools that simplify tasks and enhance productivity. My focus is on delivering solutions that are not only
  functional but also optimized for scalability and performance.
